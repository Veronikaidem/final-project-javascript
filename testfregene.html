            Fregene Beach is wide and long and has some of the best free beaches and beach clubs near Rome.
            The beach is only 30 km from the historic center of Rome and you can reach it by public transportation.
            Visit Fregene if you are looking for a place to stay outside of Rome where you can relax and breathe in the sea air. Fregene is a small coastal town near Rome a stone’s throw from the sea, with all amenities, and is also close to Fiumicino airport.
            It’s impossible to live in Rome and not know Fregene Beach.
            I spent most of the summers of my childhood playing on that beach and cycling in the delightful boulevards of this small, quiet town which is also home to 3 protected natural parks.
            Even in winter, when the view of the sea might be not so inviting, Romans love to spend a few hours of their weekends walking along the beach and dining in the excellent seafood restaurants of Fregene.
            
            Here is all the information you need to spend an unforgettable day at Fregene Beach. I’ll share with you how to get there, how to get around, and what are the best restaurants and hotels in Fregene. You will have all the knowledge to enjoy to the fullest all that this destination has to offer.
            
            Another beach I love is Spiaggia del Castello in Santa Severa, a few kilometers north of Fregene.
